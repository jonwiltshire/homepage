    <p>Right now, I'm spending time in nature thinking about my vision and where it can meet the ecological and cultural crises
<p><mark>The crisis is spiritual</mark>
        <p>I'm a musician, journalist and documentary maker particularly fascinated with spirituality, soul and our broken relationship with nature. I'm imaginging the biggest story that I can personally inhabit that serves the Earth and contributes to resolving the ecological and cultural crises. I'm in a state of transition and don't really know where it will lead. Below is a brief summary of what I've been up to in terms of work (i.e. outputs). The truth is, I spent a lot of time working at the centre of UK politics and media. I found no answers to my questions about saving the world there. The journeying I'm doing now can best be summarised poetically:
          <p>"Maybe you are searching among branches for what only appears in the roots" ~ Rumi
          <p>Releasing music is new to me, and my songs and sounds are attempts at being a conduit for the larger story of the universe. Check out my Soundcloud for more.
            <p>Right now I'm producing my own independent journalism, which focusses on philosophical, mystical and natural themes. You can see a few examples on Youtube.
              <p>I've worked for the BBC and Deutsche Welle (Germany) as a producer and reporter. And I was an independent journalist in Greece and Turkey during economic crisis and social unrest in 2013. See my journalism portfolio below.
                <p>I worked for the UK Government as a civil servant for a few years and, before that, was a climate change campaigner focussed on EU climate politics.
                  <p>I've studied economics and social sciences at the LSE and at the University of Bristol (UK). These studies focussed largely on protest movements, environmental economics, political philosophy and feminism.
